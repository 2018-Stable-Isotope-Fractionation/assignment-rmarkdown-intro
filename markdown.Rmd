This tutorial provides an introduction to [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). **Markdown** is a very basic and easy-to-use syntax for styling written documents. It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even link to [CU](http://www.colorado.edu/)!


`Exercise 1:`

 - *knit* (=render) this document by clicking the **Knit** above the code

# Headers

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents.
Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

You can use  one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to include a quote, use the > character before the line:

> My Software never has bugs. It just develops random features.


`Exercise 2:`

 - add a level 4 subheader and a quote endorsing your favorite type of pie
 - knit the document to make sure it renders correctly
 - commit your changes using the Git menu

# Lists

Sometimes you need numbered lists (here to some useful resources for markdown):

1. [Markdown Basics from R-Studio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)
1. [Mastering Markdown from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (this is where most of the examples above come from)

And sometimes you want bullet points (the kind of things you can do with R markdown
if you want to go beyond the basics):

- [Lots of options for embedded R code](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html) (more details below)
- [Bibliographies and References](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
- [Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html)
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before:
    - Like this
    - And this

# Equations

Equation support can be very handy if you need to provide some formulas in your
text, just use $\LaTeX$ [math](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics): $x=\sum\beta\frac{\pi^2}{\gamma_i}$

Or more complicated large ones:

$$
f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    n/2       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2  & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}\\
  \end{cases}
$$

`Exercise 3:`

 - type the equation for $\delta$-notation
 - knit the document to make sure it renders correctly
 - commit your changes using the Git menu


# Images

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

![Pluto loves you](http://i.space.com/images/i/000/048/999/i02/pluto-new-horizons-july-2015.jpg?1437582878)

And now time for a horizontal break and off to R!
